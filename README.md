# MachineLearningExample

This is a personal side project for learning purposes.

This program attempts to implement a simple machine learning example. It matrix multiplication and Gauss-Jordan elimination to determine variable for the equation of a line. This equation is updated everytime new data is added. After the equation variables have been calculated, the user can enter an X coordinate and the program can give the corresponding Y coordinate based off of the generated equation.

Most of the program was implemented in Java with the exception of the Gauss-Jordan elimination. The Gauss-Jordan elimination is done by using a jar produced by MATLAB.

It is currently using a set of one million generated points.
