# Machine Learning Example

This is a side project for learning purposes.

This program implements a simple machine learning example. It uses matrix multiplication and Gauss-Jordan Elimination on a set of X and Y coordinates to determine variables for the equation of a line. This equation is updated everytime new data is added. After the equation variables have been calculated, the user can enter an X coordinate and the program can give the corresponding Y coordinate based off of the generated equation.

Most of the program was implemented in Java with the exception of the Gauss-Jordan Elimination. The Gauss-Jordan Elimination is done by using a jar produced by MATLAB.

It is currently using a set of one million generated points.
